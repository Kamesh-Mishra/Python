Name: 
    List of File Names       
Filename:
    list_dict.py 
Problem Statement:
    Assume youâ€™re given the following list of files:
    ist_of_files = ['data0001.txt', 'data0002.txt','data0003.txt']

    Create a dictionary filenum where the keys are the filenames and the
    value is the file number (i.e., data0001.txt has a file number of 1) 
    as an integer.

    Make your code fill the dictionary automatically, assuming that you 
    have a list list of files.

Hint: 
    To convert a string to an integer, use the int function on the string, 
    and the list and array sub-range slicing syntax also works on strings
